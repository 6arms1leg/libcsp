# YAML interface config
#
# Each interface should have the following attributes:
#   name, driver, addr and netmask
#
# List of supported drivers:
#   can, zmq   TODO: uart, udp
#
# The following additional attirbutes are optional:
#   device: used for can, and uart typically set to /dev/ttyUSB0 or can0
#   server: used for zmq, typically set to an IP address of a zmqproxy
#   default: true, set to true on one interface only. Sets the default route to this if.
#
# EXAMPLE:
#
# - name: "CAN0"
#   driver: "can"
#   device: "vcan0"
#   addr: 66
#   netmask: 8
#
# - name: "ZMQ0"
#   driver: "zmq"
#   server: "localhost"
#   addr: 16
#   netmask: 8
#   default: true
#


- name: "CAN0"
  driver: "can"
  device: "vcan0"
  addr: 66
  netmask: 8


- name: "ZMQ0"
  driver: "zmq"
  server: "localhost"
  addr: 16
